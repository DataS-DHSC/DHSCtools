# dhsctools

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dhsctools is to provide a collection of helper functions to 
try and solve common problems experienced by analysts when using the 
Department's IT infrastructure and working on the estate. 

For more general guidance on using R in the Department please see the 
dhsc-r-guide repository.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dhsctools using:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
##library(dhsctools)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}

```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
